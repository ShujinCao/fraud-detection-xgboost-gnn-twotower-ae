# Modernized Insurance Claims Fraud Detection (Autoencoder · Two-Tower · GNN · XGBoost)
This project modernizes a legacy insurance-claims fraud detection workflow by integrating
Autoencoder anomaly scores, Two-Tower (Claimant × Provider) embeddings, and GNN-derived graph
features into an XGBoost model for calibrated fraud-risk scoring.
